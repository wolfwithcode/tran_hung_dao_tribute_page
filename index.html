            Trần Hưng Đạo was born as Prince Trần Quốc Tuấn (陳國峻) in 1228 to Prince Trần Liễu, the elder brother of the new child emperor, Trần Thái Tông, after the Trần Dynasty replaced the Lý Dynasty in 1225 AD. Some time later, Trần Liễu-- the Empress Lý Chiêu Hoàng’s brother-in-law at the time-- was forced to defer his own wife (Princess Thuận Thiên) to his younger brother Emperor Thái Tông under pressure from Imperial Regent Trần Thủ Độ to solidify Trần clan’s dynastic stability. The brothers Trần Liễu and Emperor Trần Thái Tông harboured grudges against their uncle Trần Thủ Độ for the forced marital arrangement.

Trần Quốc Tuấn, his father Trần Liễu, and Emperor Trần Thái Tông had a very close relationship. Liễu would find great tutors to teach his son, Trần Quốc Tuấn, with the hope of one day becoming a great leader of Đại Việt and regain his family honour. On his deathbed, Liễu told his son to avenge what he felt was personal shame forced upon him and his brother, Trần Thái Tông, by the Imperial Regent Tran Thu Do.
Tran Hung Dao, original name Tran Quoc Tuan, also called Hung Dao Vuong, (born 1229?—died 1300, Van Kiep, Vietnam), figure of almost legendary proportions in Vietnamese history, a brilliant military strategist who defeated two Mongol invasions and became a cultural hero among modern Vietnamese.

By the early 1280s the Vietnamese kingdom faced a growing threat from the Mongols under Kublai Khan, who had conquered China in the previous decade. When he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Vietnamese armed forces, Tran Hung Dao, in a rousing speech to his forces, called for national unity and persuaded his army to fight the invaders. When the Mongols invaded the Red River valley (in northern Vietnam) with a massive army in 1283/84, Tran gave way before the invaders and adopted a defensive strategy, using guerrilla warfare and scorched-earth tactics against them. He then launched a counteroffensive that liberated the Vietnamese capital and drove the Mongols back into China.

When the Mongols resumed their campaign against Vietnam in 1287, Tran and his forces again gave ground, avoiding a pitched battle until the Mongols had occupied the capital. After resuming the offensive, Tran engaged the Mongol fleet in battle at the mouth of the Bach Dang River in 1288. Kublai Khan’s junks, lured by Hung Dao’s men, were ripped apart by iron-tipped spears that had been implanted beneath the waters—a strategy borrowed from an earlier Vietnamese warrior, Ngo Quyen (939).
